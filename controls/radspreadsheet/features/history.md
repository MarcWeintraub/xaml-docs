# History

The `RadSpreadSheet` control uses the [SpreadProcessing library](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/document-processing/libraries/radspreadprocessing/overview) as its document model. This library provides a history functionality that you can access via the `Workbook.History` property of RadSpreadsheet. You can also retrieve the history via the `ActiveSheet.Workbook.History` and `ActiveWorksheet.Workbook.History` properties of RadSpreadsheet.

>tip More information about the history functionality can be found in this [article](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/document-processing/libraries/radspreadprocessing/features/history).
