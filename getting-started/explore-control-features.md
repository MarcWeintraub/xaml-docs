# Explore UI for WPF Control Features

Once you have the controls [working in your project]({%slug getting-started-first-steps%}), it's time to see what they can do. This article provides a short overview of how to get started with finding control functionality so you can use it.

## Demos

To get an overview of what each control offers, the fastest approach is download the [WFP Demos Application](http://demos.telerik.com/wpf).

You can also [download the source code of the demo application]({%slug installing-wpf-demos%}#getting-the-source-code) from your [telerik.com account](https://www.telerik.com/account/downloads/product-download?product=RCWPF) as a Visual Studio project and play around with the demos in the comfort of your IDE. The `Telerik_UI_for_WPF_[version]_Demos.zip` archive contains the respective source code.

## Explore properties and tags

You can **explore** the available properties, events and inner tags of any control through the VS **intellisense** to get a quick glimpse of their concepts and availability.

You will also find **design-time wizards** and **links** that can be useful when you are getting started with a feature, or even for advanced users who want to save time with setting up collections, data sources or properties.
