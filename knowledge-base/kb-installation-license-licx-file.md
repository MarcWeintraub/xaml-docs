## Description

In some versions of Telerik UI for WPF, after referencing the Telerik assemblies, the Visual Studio Designer can generate a [license.licx](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/lc-exe-license-compiler) file in the __Properties__ folder of the WPF project. The file lists the Telerik dlls used at design-time, along with their concrete versions. This can bring errors when changing the version of the referenced Telerik dlls.

## Solution

The file is automatically generated by Visual Studio and it is not necessary for building an running the project, or for redistributing the application. You can safely delete it.
